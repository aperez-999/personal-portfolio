                Hi, I'm Alejandro Perez, an 18-year-old Computer Science student at Florida International 
                University's Honors College. Born and raised in Miami, Florida, I come from a Hispanic 
                backgroundâ€”both of my parents are from Cuba.

              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                From a young age, I've always been drawn to computers. That curiosity ultimately led me 
                to pursue a degree in Computer Science, where I could turn my passion for computers into a career.

              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer, creating websites and applications 
                that are not only visually appealing but also efficient and seamless in their functionality.
