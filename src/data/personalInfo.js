  aboutMe: `I am a passionate and dedicated Computer Science student at Florida International University, 
  with a strong focus on web development and software engineering. My journey in programming began with 
  a curiosity about how websites work, which led me to explore various programming languages and frameworks.
  
  I enjoy building responsive and user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems. My goal is 
  to become a skilled Full Stack Developer, capable of handling both front-end and back-end development with ease.
  
  When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and expanding 
  my knowledge through online courses and tutorials.`
